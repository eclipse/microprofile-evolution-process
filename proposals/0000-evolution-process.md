## Introduction

The microprofile evolution process provides a lightweight process structure to support decision making processes for new features, enhancements or other modifications to the microprofile itself.

Mailinglist thread: [Discussion thread topic for that proposal](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/microprofile/k1QWK4iGm1k)

## Motivation

Ideas for extensions to the microprofile are discussed continuously on the mailing list, but beyond the ideation phase, it is unclear how to move proposals from inception to implementation. The evolution process should explain new contributors what's expected in terms of contents, help the group coordinate the decision making processes and act as an archive that allows to identify and reference proposals at a later point in time.

## Proposed solution

The proposed solution builds on four main elements/ideas:

- Agreement on the roles participating in the process. These roles need to be supported by the group.
- Constraints on the formality and required content for proposals
- A description of the processes structure to take proposals from inception to a decision whether it will become part of the microprofile
- A repository, plus PR workflow to create, review and decide on new proposals

## Detailed design

See https://github.com/microprofile/evolution/blob/master/process.md

## Impact on existing code

None

## Alternatives considered

This process is inspired by the swift lang evolution processes. We also looked at the rust lang RFC process.
